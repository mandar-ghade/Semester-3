# Unit Tangent Vector of a Smooth Curve


If $C$ is a smooth curve defined by a vector function $\vec r(t)$,

The unit tangent vector is: 

$$\wrap{
	\hat T(t) &= \frac{\vec r\ '(t)}{\mag{\vec r\ '(t)}}
}$$

$\hat T(t)$ points in the **direction of motion.**
- Length remains constant.
- Only its direction changes as the particle moves around the curve.
- Magnitude of ROC of this vector (with respect to length) along the curve gives information about **how quickly the curve is changing direction**.
	- This is called the [[curvature]].
