## R,S Nomenclature
- System of naming to specify exactly how atoms are arranged in space based on their connectivity to a chiral atom.
- How to make absolute configuration of a chiral carbon (R or S):
	1) Identify chiral carbon
	2) Assign priority to the 4 atoms or substituents attached to that chiral carbon (Based on Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules)
	3) Position molecule (in space) such that the group of lowest priority (#4) is away from your perspective.
	1) Trace the priority sequence => #1 -> #2 -> #2
		- If clockwise: R
		- If counterclockwise: S
## Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Rules
- "Sequential" rules
	- Cannot skip, consider each rule at a time.
1) Rank substituents by atomic number # of the attached atom
	- Higher atomic number = higher priority
	- $\ce{I > Br > Cl > O > N}, etc$ 
2) If atoms attached to chiral atom have same atomic member, go along the substituent to the first point of difference:
3) Substituents (groups) with multiple ($\ce{C=O, C#O, C=C}$) are given single bond equivalents (fiction; also called "phantoms")

See from the perspective that is lowest priority.
