# 3-D Rectangular System

## 3D Rectangular Coordinate System ($R^3$)
- Created by adding a new axis called the $z$ axis.
- $z$ axis inserted through the origin perpendicular to the $xy$-plane.
- 8 octants ($x, y, z \geq 0$)
- Planes:
	- $xy$ - ($z = 0$)
	- $yz$ - ($x = 0$)
	- etc
- Ex: $P_1 (2, 3, -2)$ , $P_2 (0, -1, 2)$

### Distance Formula in $R^3$
* $P_1$ means point 1
* $P_2$ means point 2
$$|P_1P_2| = \sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)+(z_1-z_2)^2}$$

### Equation of a sphere:
$$(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2+(z-c)^2=r^2$$
$$\text{center}=(a,b,c)$$
Midpoint formula works the same between points in $3D$ as it did in $2D$, just don't forget to account for $z$.

Complete the square if a sphere formula is expanded (remember add ${(\frac{b}{2})}^{2}$ to both sides of the equation).
