(Chapter 3.1)

# Chirality
- Handedness of an object or molecule.
- Left and right hands are mirror images.
- Non-superimposable
- Practice by rotating in 3D (180$\deg$)

## Chiral object
- Non-superimposable
### Enantiomers:
  - Non-superimposable mirror image *stereoisomers*
  - Identical properties (mp, bp, density, solubility)
  - Distinguishable based on their response to the rotation of the plane polarized light.

#### Diastereomers
  - Stereoisomers that are **not mirror images** of each other; refers to relationship among two+ objects.
  - Arise whenever there are 2 or more stereocenters in a molecule

## Achiral Object 
- Superimposable
- An object whose mirror image is superimposable on the original structure
- Identical

## Chiral Carbon
- Chiral atom = A chiral center = A type of stereoisomer
- $\ce{C}$ with 4 different substituents
  - $sp^3$ only.
  - Ex: 2-butanol (includes 1 $\ce{H}$)
- Identify them with a star.

## Important rules
1) Molecules with one chiral atom (exactly) are chiral.
  - Tldr; if just one chiral atom, it's chiral
2) Molecules with no chiral atoms may be chiral or achiral.
  - Tldr; even with no chiral atoms, it's chirality can be either.
3) Molecules with 2+ chiral atoms may be chiral or achiral.
  - Tldr; even with multiple chiral atoms, it's chirality can be either.
- Flip & test
- Check each functional group
### If 2+ chiral atoms
- Look for internal mirror planes of symmetry
  - Achiral
#### Internal Planes of Symmetry
- Called "$\sigma$ planes"
- If you can cut it in two mirror half, then has plane of symmetry ($\sigma$ plane) and is achiral.
- (Even if looks chiral, if it has $\sigma$ plane, it breaks its asymmetry. Making it achiral.)

## Racemic Mixture
- 50%/50% mixture of enantiomers

## Bicycloalkanes
- Have atleast 2 Bridge-head carbons
- Bicyclo[(longest) chain length, (middle) chain length, (shortest) chain length]-(carbon count)
  - Ex: Bicyclo[3, 3, 0]octane

## Meso Compounds
- Molecules that have chiral centers but are achiral.
  - Destroys chirality
