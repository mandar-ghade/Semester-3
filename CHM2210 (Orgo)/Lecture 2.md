# Formal Charge and Molecular Shape
-  Formal Charge
- All atoms need to be neutral in lewis structure
- Used to keep track of e^- in molecules
- Sum of FCs must equal overall charge of molecule
$$\text{Formal Charge} = \text{\# valence $e^-$ (from periodic table)} - \text{\# non-bonding $e^-$} - \frac{1}{2}(\text{\#$e^-$nonbonding})$$

Also $C_3H_8$ (propane) is tetrahedral structure (109.5$\degree$) because methane ($CH_4$) has $sp^3$ hybridization, and therefore has tetrahedral structure.

Hydrogens on hetero-atoms ($S,N,O,P$) are always drawn.(NOT CARBON)
