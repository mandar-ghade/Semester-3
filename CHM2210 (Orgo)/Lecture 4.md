## Food
- Caffeine

## Hybridization review (re-do this section of notes)
- $s$'s size depends on principle quantum number
	- spherical
- $p$ - oval

$\sigma$ bonds caused by overlapping of orbitals (stronger)
- $\sigma^*$ - anti-bonding
- can be created by head-to-head overlap of p-orbitals.
- end-to-end
- Single bonds
$\pi$ -  side-to-side overlap:
- weak
- p-orbitals
