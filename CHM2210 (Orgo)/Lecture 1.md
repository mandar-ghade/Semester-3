## Review from General Chemistry
- Structure of the Atom (Protons + Neutrons = mass of atom)

- Electronic Structure of Atom 
	- Shells:
		- E-s confined to regions of space, different distances from nucleus (n = 1, 2, ...)
	- Orbitals:
		- Describes distribution of electron density in space.
			- $s$ (1 / shell), 
			- $p$ (3 / shell),
			- $d$ (5 / shell),
			* $f$ (7 / shell)

- Electron Config:
	- Pauli Exclusion & Aufbau Rules.
	- Aufbau Principle:
		- Orbitals fill from *lowest* to *highest* energy
	- Pauli Exclusion;
		- Only 2 e's per orbital.
		- Spins must be "opposite" ("paired)
	- Hund's Rule:
		- For a set of degenerate orbitals, add $e$ in each one before a second is added in any case.

* Lewis dot structures, Valence bond theory, Octet rule.
	* Electrons shared between atoms to achieve stable *octet* configuration.
	* Valence e's that are shared are used to form chemical bonds.
* Lewis structures:
	* Symbol represents nucleus and innermost e's
	* Dots represent valence e's.


* Lewis Structures of Molecules:
	* $CH_4$ (Methane) ($AX_4$)
		* Covalently bonded.
	* $CH_3OH$ (Methanol) - *Polar and Non-polar bonds*
		* Polar covalent bond between O and outer H. ($AX_2E_2$ - aka 2 lone pairs - aka *bent*)
		* Dash and Wedge for 2$H$ in $CH_3$
		* $\mu\gt0$ = polar
