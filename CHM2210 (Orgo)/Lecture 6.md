# Resonance and Resonance Structures

Resonance - represents movement of electrons.

Rules for Drawing Resonance Structures:
- Only non-bonded (lone pairs) e or e in multiple bonds move, or are delocalized.
	- Atoms and single bonds do not move
	- Resonance deals with e' in the pi-system (in p orbitals)
- Every **resonance structure** has a valid lewis structure.

Rules for predicting best resonance structure among collection of drawn structures:
1) **Preserve the octet rule.** (The most important)
	- Pay attention to carbocations
2) Minimize formal charges, maximize the # of bonds (neutral more favorable).
	- (we want fewer atoms that have their own charges).
3) Minimize charge separation (distance between charges).
	- (Very important)
	- Keep in mind electrostatic forces.
	- $-$ furthest is best
	- $-$ and $+$ together - should be closer.
4) Negative charges on the most electronegative atom 
	- When drawing resonance structures, make sure to move e- to most electronegative.
